Every medium needs a bibliographic citation: that’s a reference to where the
medium itself was actually pulled from.

Ensure sections are related to URIs, not Traits.

Articles (and URIs) have many sections, not one, and ONE of them is “primary.”

…Not sure if we should do that with a one-to-many plus many-to-many or with a
flag on the join model. Hmmmn. The latter is more error-prone…

literature references apply to all associatables, not just media. NBD…

Add some attribution stuff directly to the translations table.

Rename CollectionAttribution to just “Attribution” …tis enough.

Add a “location” (string) to names. It’s rare, but useful.
